> Pytorch implementation for codes in A Multimodal Irony Recognition Framework With Self-Supervise Multi-task Learning.

本项目参考了下面的论文和代码

[Learning Modality-Specific Representations with Self-Supervised Multi-Task Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (AAAI2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04830). Please see their another repo [MMSA](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA) for more details, which is a scalable framework for MSA.
